## Work Experience
**Machine learning @ Egencia(American Express Global Business Travel) (_April 2024 - October 2024)**
- Developed and implemented a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate SQL queries from natural language questions.
- Evaluated the model’s performance using relevant metrics to ensure high-quality results.
- Designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enable dynamic and interactive database querying.
- Deployed the model and collaborated with the product team for real-world testing.
- Continuously improved the generation pipeline based on feedback from testers and internal users.

**Data Scientist @ Direct Assurance  (_March 2023 - August 2023)**
- Set up a clean and reliable database, providing a solid foundation for developing predictive models.
- Developed a Machine Learning model to predict the user’s channel for obtaining quotes.
- Created a Machine Learning model to predict the probability of conversion based on the selected plan.
- Optimized price gaps between different plans using the “Ratebook” optimization technique.
- Contributed to the production deployment in a cloud environment and conducted A/B testing on the models.

**Data Analyst/Engineer @ Sanofi (_September 2022 - March 2023)**
- Cleaned and prepared data for analysis using Snowflake and Alteryx.
- Developed a Machine Learning model to predict the user’s channel for obtaining quotes.
- Structured the internal audit DataLake on Snowflake by designing and implementing data pipelines.
- Performed data analysis dashboards to assist auditors during their assignments.
