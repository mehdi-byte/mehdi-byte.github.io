## Projects
**üå≥ Optimal Decision Tree Generation Using F-Modeling**

[code_project](https://github.com/mehdi-byte/RO)

In the rapidly evolving field of data science and machine learning, building optimal decision trees remains a critical challenge for classification and predictive analysis. This project aimed to generate optimal decision trees using F-modeling, leveraging both univariate and multivariate splits as well as naive and exact data grouping methods.

üéØ Objectives & Approach:

	‚Ä¢	Datasets: Initial testing was conducted on the Iris, Wine, and Seeds datasets. To assess the robustness of the approach, two additional datasets were included:
	‚Ä¢	Mushroom: A dataset containing 23 species of mushrooms, classified as edible or toxic.
	‚Ä¢	Dry Bean Seeds: A dataset used for classifying seven types of beans based on 12 dimensions and four shape-related characteristics.
	‚Ä¢	Methods:
	‚Ä¢	Data Processing: Implemented two main functions:
	‚Ä¢	main(): Processes data without prior grouping.
	‚Ä¢	main-merge(): Processes data with prior grouping based on tree depth (D ‚àà {2, 3, 4}).
	‚Ä¢	Tree Construction: Applied F-modeling to generate optimal decision trees, testing the impact of different tree depths, split types, and grouping strategies.

üìä Key Contributions:

	‚Ä¢	Performance Analysis: Measured computation time and classifier performance relative to datasets, tree depth, split strategy, and grouping method.
	‚Ä¢	Optimization: Explored advanced optimization techniques, such as grouping innovations, valid inequalities, and refined F-modeling approaches, to enhance computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.

This project provided an opportunity to deepen understanding of optimal decision trees and contributed to the broader field of machine learning by exploring innovative optimization strategies.
